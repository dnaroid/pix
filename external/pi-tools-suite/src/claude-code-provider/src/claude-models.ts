/**
 * Report which concrete model each picker alias would be served, by reading the
 * CLI's `aliases` table embedded in the Claude Code executable.
 *
 * This is an undocumented internal, and a deliberate, scoped exception to this
 * project's rule of consuming only published interfaces. It is the only
 * zero-cost source that can report all four aliases: `system/init` resolves them
 * but is unreachable without a billed turn, and a model that is never served is
 * never observed, so Fable could not be reported on a Pro account at all.
 *
 * It is diagnostic only. Nothing outside the doctor may read this, and it must
 * never influence routing: the serving path stays alias-only, which is what
 * makes a wrong answer here harmless. Every failure mode leaves the alias
 * out, which the doctor reports as "undetermined", rather than reporting a
 * version it is not sure of.
