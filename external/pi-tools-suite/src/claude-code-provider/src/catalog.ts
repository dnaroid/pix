/**
 * Every alias has the same context window on every subscription tier: Claude
 * Code serves Sonnet 5, Fable 5.1, and Opus 5.5 with their native 1M window
 * on Pro as well as Max, Team, and Enterprise. The window needs no usage
 * credits, though Fable itself does on Pro. Each
 * maxTokens is Claude Code's own default output cap for the model the alias
 * serves. The paid model matrix asserts both against what Claude Code reports
 * for a real login; see DEVELOPING.md for the baseline the gate runs against.
 *
 * The captured request fixtures disagree, and are not evidence: they are taken
 * against a loopback server with a dummy token, where Claude Code resolves no
 * subscription and reports its unauthenticated default.
 *
 * The doctor reports a served window that stops matching the configured one,
 * because Pi places its compaction threshold by the configured value.
